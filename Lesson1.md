Updating Editor
---
* If your editor (*username*.**indyphp.com**) does not show "Editor V1.1" at the top, you need to update the code
* This update fixes attribute problems and improves running scripts by putting the output in an iframe rather than a pop-up.

**Update Procedure**
1. Press the Shell button and run these commands:
2. **git clone http://github.com/stgnet/editor**
3. **cp editor/editor.php .**
4. Return to the Editor tab and press CTRL-R to reload
5. Confirm that the title reads "Editor V1.1"
