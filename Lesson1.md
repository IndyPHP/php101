Lesson #1 - Echo, Variables, IF
===

Feb 2, 2013 - **Updated instructions for editor v1.1 update**

Review & Info
---
* Use your IndyPhp.com class account to edit and run PHP scripts
* Use GITHUB (see Lesson0) to view class lessons and materials
* HTML and CSS (video missing from Lesson0) will be incorporated through subsequent classes
* An updated version of the **editor.php** script is now available

Updating Editor
---
* If your editor ( _username_.indyphp.com/editor.php ) does not show "Editor V1.1" at the top, you need to update the code
* This update fixes attribute problems and improves running scripts by putting the output in an iframe rather than a pop-up.
* To return the file editing mode after pressing RUN, press the EDIT button again.

**Update Procedure**
* Press the Shell button and run these commands:
* **git clone http://github.com/stgnet/editor**
* **cp editor/editor.php .**
 * . refers to the current directory, thus same as **cp editor/editor.php ./editor.php**
* Return to the Editor tab and press CTRL-R to reload
* Confirm that the title reads "Editor V1.1"

Video Series
---
* Many thanks to Andrew Cutting of PLTW for passing along a great [educational video series on PHP](http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC960338B143E7F889)
* We will be using these in this class, but also filling in with class projects each 4th Saturday when we come together to review.
* Our target goal is not only to show you how to develop in PHP, but also build some useful tools and real websites along the way.

1A: Echo
---
* Watch video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK1tBB9nHUE
* Follow along using our class editor tool to recreate the same PHP, SAVE as Lesson1a.php, and RUN it.
* Note that when the presentor talks about "full stop" he means the period character (.)

1B: Variables
---
* Watch video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv9Yx0YzyOw
* Follow along and run the example as Lesson1b.php
* Note the difference between single and double quoted strings

1C: If, Else
---
* Watch video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWyh7H1lAmQ
* Follow along and run the example as Lesson1c.php

Feedback?
---
* Are these video lessons working for you?
* Is 3 lessons per week too little - should we move through the material faster?
* Please email your comments to [scott@griepentrog.com](mailto:scott@griepentrog.com)
